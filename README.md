# Pet's Care Store

## This is an E-commerce Web Development Project.
<br>
The Pet's Care app displays 3 different categories of products for three kinds of pets that are: Cats, Dogs, and Birds. The three categories include Clothes, Accessories, and Food. This project is inspired by the PetsMall.pk app which is again an e-commerce pet store. Our app beautifully displays the products with useful information for the customer to buy products easily with the comfort of staying at home. The app guides users properly for a better user experience and they can readily make a purposeful use of it. The app handles the user data gracefully at the backend.

This is a MERN Stack project done by 3 students in the 6th semester of our BSCS.
